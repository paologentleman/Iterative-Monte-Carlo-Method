Main purpose of this study is to illustrate the characteristics of the statistical model for dealing with the Dugongâ€™s data and run some specific Bayesian analysis tools over it. Lengths ( $$Y_i$$ ) and ages ( $x_i ) of 27 dugongs (yes the huge marine [mammal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugong)) captured off the coast of Queensland have been recorded and the following (non linear) regression model is considered in [Carlin and Gelfand (1991)](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/Gelfand91.pdf).
